		Research notes
			Cloud waves break along the coast,
			The twin suns sink beneath the sea,
			The shadows grow longer
			In Carcosa. 

			Strange is the night when black stars rise,
			And strange moons circle through the sky,
			But stranger still is
			The lost Carcosa. 

			Songs that the Hyades shall sing there,
			Where the king's rags flutter,
			Must die unheard in
			Gloomy Carcosa. 

			Song of my soul, my voice is dead;
			Die thou, unsung, like unshed tears that
			Shall dry and die in the
			Lost Carcosa.
