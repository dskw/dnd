Elemental plane of fire: The glowing inferno landscape stretches out before you, where the ground consists of glowing lava flowing in deep gorges. Smouldering rocks and obsidian-like formations rise up from the glowing mass. A swaying underground of heat-resistant rock forms the path for brave adventurers, while hot winds whirl clouds of ash through the air.

Elemental level of the earth: Massive rock formations and endless caves characterize the landscape, while the ground consists of solid, often brittle rock. Deep trenches and caves criss-cross the terrain, while living earth elementals occasionally roam the ground. Mineral crystals and gemstones shimmer in the faint light that filters through crevices.

Elemental plane of the air: an endless sky in which cloud formations and stormy winds characterize the landscape. There is no solid ground here, but floating platforms made of transparent ether or solid clouds. The feeling of weightlessness is omnipresent as players navigate between the flying islands held aloft by dizzying heights.

Elemental Plane of Water: An impenetrable depth where oceans of living water and frozen glaciers exist. The bottom consists of fluctuating water, from clear lakes to deep seabeds. Coral reefs and living algae fields stretch below the surface. Transparent paths of liquid water allow adventurers to move through this humid world.
